HOWTO SETUP A FAKE TAPE ENVIRONMENT
-----------------------------------

Introduction:
-------------

The fake tape driver (vtape) attempts to simulate a tape drive from a low level
aspect. It emulates tape operations like fsf, bsf, weom, variable bloc, etc..

For that the driver implements 5 operations :
 - read
 - write
 - open
 - close
 - ioctl

Setup the regress environment for tape tests
--------------------------------------------

Be sure to add this to your config file :

USE_VTAPE=yes

And type "make setup" (or "make sed" in a existing environment)

That all !


Setup a quite big autochanger (5 drives and 80 slots)
-----------------------------------------------------

Just run "./tests/vtape-test-changer" test to use right configuration files,
then you can use "./scripts/prepare-fake-autochanger" script to initialize the
dummy autochanger.
