# The following are used only if you want to run Win32 tests, which

# There are a few Win32 tests e.g. tests/win32-test where this will
#   work. You must specify the client name, its address, and a 
#   file (which may be a directory) on the machine to backup.
#   It will be backed up and restored to c:/tmp, but no checking
#   of the resulting restore data is done.
