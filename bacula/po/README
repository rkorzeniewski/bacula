Notes about Bacula translations.
--------------------------------

---

To edit .po files, I recommend poedit, downloadable at http://www.poedit.org/ .

---

To refresh bacula.pot and *.po, when some strings have been added, modified or
removed from the sources files, run:

# make update-po

---

To refresh Bacula source files list (POTFILES.in), when a source file is
added or removed from the repository, run:

# make gen-potfiles && make update-po

Note, the gen-potfiles pulls in all files found under the top
directory, so it is much better to do something like:

cd bacula
rm -rf x
svn checkout https://bacula.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/bacula/trunk/bacula x
cd x
./configure <options>
cd po
make gen-potfiles
cp POTFILES.in <real-source-tree/po>
cd ..
./configure <options>

This avoids picking up any files that are not in the SVN.

---

To add a new translation language (e.g. German), add a new line to LINGUAS
containing the language code (e.g. de), then run:
# msginit -l <full locale> (e.g. "# msginit -l de_DE")

Open the newly created file in an editor (e.g. de.po), and look for this line:
"Project-Id-Version: ...\n"
If it still look like this:
"Project-Id-Version: PACKAGE VERSION\n"
Correct it to:
"Project-Id-Version: Bacula 1.38\n"

You may also want to correct the language team to:
"Language-Team: German <bacula-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>\n"

Finally, add <language code>.mo (e.g. de.mo) to .cvsignore, and don't forget to
run:
# svn add <language code>.po <language code>.gmo
