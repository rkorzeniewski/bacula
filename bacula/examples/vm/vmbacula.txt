Tape Mount Client/Server for z/VM

This package provides a simple Linux client and a VM disconnected
virtual machine allowing Linux applications to mount and manage
tapes hosted by a z/VM systems.

The tools were written to support running Bacula, a open-source
file level backup tool, as a Linux appliance running in a z/VM
virtual machine, however they are general purpose enough to
employ with other applications with some minor thought.  The
application consists of a Perl script to run within the Linux
guest, and a REXX/CMS Pipelines-based server to interact with a
CMS-based tape management system.

This package contains only the support for basic VM tape
operations, and does not include support for the popular
commercial TMS systems such as CA-VM:Tape or others.  A
commercially supported version is available for a fee from Sine
Nomine and includes detailed documentation, 24x7 support, and
additional features.  Please contact Sine Nomine at info (at)
sinenomine.net for information and pricing for the full
commercial version of the software.
