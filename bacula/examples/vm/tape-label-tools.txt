Subject: RE: [Bacula-devel] ANSI label tape creation tools for VM
Date: Thu, 17 Feb 2005 11:03:26 -0500

I don't seem to have a way to update the CVS (nor really a lot of
experience with *update* access to the beastie), so appended below are
some example scripts to use on a z/VM system to create labeled tapes
suitable for use with the ANSI label support in Bacula. I suggest that
we put these in the "examples" section of the tree as contributed tools
-- I'll leave it to your discretion as to where/how to tag these. 

I'm finishing up the documentation and packaging for my z/VM tape mount
helper daemon and mtx-changer variant, so you may want to think about
where those should go as well. 

File BLABELA EXEC is the script for creating ANSI labeled tapes with the
proper signature.

File BLABELI EXEC is a variation of the above script for creating IBM SL
label tapes with the proper signature. 

File BACULA.DATA is a dummy file required by the annoying fact that the
OS simulation routines in CMS require an actual file as input to the OS
sim file creation utility (grr).
