This directory contains example Device resource 
definitions that are known to work for various
tape drives.

In general, you can set the Name record
and the Media Type to anything you want, but
they must correspond with what you have in your
Director's config file.

The Archive Device must be changed to agree
with your physical device depending on the system
and the drive.

There are many other records that you might want
to add as well.
