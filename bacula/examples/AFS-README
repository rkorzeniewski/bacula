Subject: [Bacula-users] OpenAFS with bacula

Hi,
    I'm using Bacula for backing up an AFS file set. I don't know if 
anyone else is doing it, but here is my explaination about how Bacula 
works with it.

I'm using Bacula 1.26a on a RedHat Linux 7.1 on the Bacula Director 
machine and RedHat Linux 7.1 and OpenAFS 1.26 on the Bacula client machine.

First make a user bacula in your kas server an give him rl permission on 
all volumes that you want to backup with Bacula.

In order for bacula-fd to reads the files on your
AFS server you have to give the client a kerberos ticket with 
the right privileges to read the volumes. Here my script to 
obtain the ticket.

I made a script that obtains the tiket and then runs bacula-fd,

I put this script in /sbin/afs-bacula with permissions 700.
(See current directory for a copy)

Then you have to change the bacula-fd start/stop script.
Replace the line

daemon /usr/local/sbin/bacula-fd $2 -c /usr/local/etc/bacula-fd.conf

with

/sbin/afs_bacula daemon /usr/local/sbin/bacula-fd $2 -c \
    /usr/local/etc/bacula-fd.conf


Ok that's all. You've got a bacula-fd validated with the kerberos server.

Note: Don't forget that kerberos tickets have a life time :)
