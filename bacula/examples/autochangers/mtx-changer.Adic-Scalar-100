So far this seems to be working for me, but it's not all quite finished :)

I'm trying to setup a surestore 12000e autochanger so far in my 
bacula-sd.conf  i have added this
Device {
  Name = autochanger                     #
  Media Type = DDS-2
  Archive Device = /dev/sa1
  AutomaticMount = yes;               # when device opened, read it
  AlwaysOpen = yes;
  LabelMedia = yes;
  RemovableMedia = yes;
  Autochanger = yes;
  Changer Device = /dev/pass0 #changer device
}
But i need to make an entry for the Changer Command =   .I have 
installed mtx but there are no sample files to be found or any
bacula samples for autochangers
Cheers Terry
