Release 7.0.0

 Bacula code: Total files = 713 Total lines = 305,722
 The diff between Bacula 5.2.13 and Bacula 7.0.0 is 622,577 lines,
 which represents very large change.

This is a major new release with many new features and a
number of changes. Please take care to test this code carefully
before putting it into production.  Although the new features
have been tested, they have not run in a production environment.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For packagers, if you change options, naming, and the way 
we link our shared object files, as at least one of you does,
you are creating a situation where the user may not be able
to run multiple versions of Bacula on the same machine, which
is often very useful, and in addition, you create a configuration
that the project cannot properly support.

Please note that the documentation has significantly changed.
You will need additional packages to build it such as inkscape.
Please see the README and README.pct files in the docs directory.
The packages come with pre-build English pdf and html files,
which are located in the docs/docs/manuals/en/pdf-and-html directory.

Packagers: please note that the Bacula LICENSE has changed, it is still
AGPLv3 and still open source. A new requirement has been added which
requires other projects using the source to keep the acreditations.

Packagers: please note that the docs license has changed. It is now 
licensed: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International
This is a common open source license.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
