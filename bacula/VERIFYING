All Bacula packages released on Source Forge after 8 June 2003
will be signed with the Bacula Distribution Verification Key.  By
obtaining a copy of the Bacula Distribution Verification Public
key from either the home site (www.bacula.org) or from the Source
Forge project page, (www.sourceforge.net/projects/bacula).  you
can verify that the code you have is complete, unaltered, and
packaged by myself (Kern Sibbald) or D. Scott Barninger.

Putting the Bacula Key in your Keyring:

Once you download the Bacula public key, you must insert it in
your keyring.  The procedure will differ depending on whether you
are using PGP or GPG.  For GPG, assuming you have put the key
in bacula.key, the procedure is:

  gpg --import bacula.key

Verifying an RPM:

The procedure for verification differs slightly if you are using
rpms or tar.gz files. For rpms, the signature becomes part of the
rpm package, and once the Bacula public key is in your keyring
you check the package with:

  rpm --checksig bacula-1.xx.rpm

Verifying tar files:

Tar files are distributed as they always have been in the past,
unchanged. However, for each xxxx.tar.gz file that is released there
will be a second file released with the same name but with .sig
appended, for example xxxx.tar.gz.sig.  To verify the Bacula distribution,
you download both the files and put them in the same directory, then
for GPG, you use the following command to do the verification:

  gpg --verify xxxx.tar.gz.sig
