  <h1>Bacula File Daemon @BACULA_VERSION@</h1>
  <p>
    Bacula is on Open Source, enterprise ready, network based backup program.
    This installer package contains the bacula file daemon for Mac OS X 10.4
    or later built as an universal binary for PPC and Intel processors.
  </p>
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>
    The bacula file daemon is only the client component of the backup system.
    For proper operation the file daemon needs to have access to a bacula
    director and storage daemon, typically installed on a server machine in
    the local network.
  </p>
  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>
    Open the Bacula File Daemon @BACULA_VERSION@ installer package and follow
    the directions given to you.
  </p>
  <h2>Configuration</h2>
  <p>
    After the installation is complete you have to adapt the configuration
    file to your needs. The file is located in system-wide Preferences folder:
    <pre>/Library/Preferences/bacula/bacula-fd.conf</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The configuration file contains passwords and
    therefore must not be accessible for any users except root. Use the
    following command line to edit the file as root-user:
    <pre>sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /Library/Preferences/bacula/bacula-fd.conf</pre>
  </p>
  <h2>Operating the File Daemon</h2>
  <p>
    Use launchctl to enable and disable the bacula file daemon.
    <pre>sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.bacula.bacula-fd.plist</pre></br>
    <pre>sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.bacula.bacula-fd.plist</pre></br>
  </p>
  <h2>Uninstalling the File Daemon</h2>
  <p>
    Doubleclick the script uninstaller.command to remove the bacula file
    daemon completely from your system.
