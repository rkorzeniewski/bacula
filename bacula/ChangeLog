2002-xx-xx Version 1.26 (04Oct02)
General: From kes06Oct02
- Implemented first major cut of bscan -- program to scan a tape
  and recreate a Bacula catalog.
- Fixed lseek() relative negative seek that prevented writing multiple
  jobs to a File volume.
- Implemented BB02 tape format -- currently turned off for writing.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Updated README
- Implemented new BB02 tape format, which moves the VolSessionId and
  VolSessionTime from the record headers into the Block header.  It
  is currently turned off.
- Implemented new btime time/date format on the tape. This is currently
  turned off.
- Added JobStatus to EOS tape label. This is currently turned off.
- Changed start_block, ... to StartBlock in JCR for uniformity.
- Print a message telling which tables were dropped/made with  
  ./drop_bacula_tables.
- Return JobType and JobLevel in db_get_job_record().
- Implemented get_current_btime(), which returns btime_t.
- Bump debug message max size to 2000 bytes.
- Add btime_t serial/unserial routines.
- Rework all tape label routines to integrate btime and other
  label format changes (currently turned off -- for writing).
- Fix lseek() to always be positive -- block.c
- Consolidate record, block, and label major #defines in block.h.
- Major implementation of bscan. Some more minor tweaking will be
  necessary.  E.g. add multiple records for multiple simultaneous
  Jobs.
- Cleanup lseek() to always use off_t as second argument.
- Add new "created" tape label (EOT_LABEL). This generates a callback
  to the read_records() routine when the final end of all tapes is
  reached allowing proper termination and updating of the media records.

General: From kes25Sep02
- Added means to bind servers to specific address.
- Documentation

Changes submitted this submission:
- Added DirAddress, FDAddress, and SDAddress records to the corresponding
  resources that allow the server to bind to a specific address 
  rather than any address.  This security improvement was suggested by
  a user -- thank you.
- Eliminated deprecated "Address" record from all sample Storage resources.
- Made quite a lot of improvements to the bscan program. Much more
  to do. Aside from details, it is able to recreate a database
  from which you can do a restore.
- The s option is not accepted on all versions of ar, so replaced it
  by an explicit ranlib call.
- Fixed a bug that caused the Director to crash if you rudely bring
  down the console program in the middle of an SQL command.
- Fixed a bug (missing break) that caused scheduled Admin jobs to
  be listed as "Unknown type".
- Removed old code from Storage daemon that used a separate FD port.

General:  From kes14Sep02
- Better key generation on non OpenSSL systems.
- 64 bit file address support if available.
- Implement autochanger for reading
- Lots of cleanup of tape reading code.
- Automatically create all Pool resources when Bacula starts.
- Implement bscan.c
- Implement autochanger use via the Console commands "add" and "label"
- Begin implementation of a regression script 
- Write bootstrap after ever job

Changes submitted this submission:
- After noticing that the non OpenSSL random key generator was
  not good on Solaris, John wrote a very nice randpass generator.
- Integrated John's makeSessionKey for generating the FD->SD
  authorization.
- Statically link tools (doesn't work on Solaris).
- Document how to debug Bacula (new chapter in the manual)
- Remove unneeded printing of error message in sql_get.c
- Free SD description config record (previous oversight)
- Bash spaces when sending Director names, and unbash them when 
  received.
- Ensure no divide by zero in rate computation in backup.c
- Implement WriteBootstrap in backup.c
- Allow tape reading to request volume information for any
  volume.
- Create all Pool resources at startup.
- Show only Backup jobs in Restore listing of last 20 Jobs.
- Handle 64 bit stat packets in restore.
- Don't do shell expansion on store_dir in config if string 
  starts with |.  This is used for piping the program for the
  WriteBootstrap.
- Ignore SIGHUP -- DéjàGnu was triggering this. 
- Implement autochanger for reading, many changes to 
  acquire_device_for_read()
- Implement callback for reading Volume. Implement in bextract,
  bls, and bscan.
- Implement bscan
- Add count to bsr.
- Fix Volume in bsr.
- Move autochanger code to new subroutine in mount.c


2002-09-05 Version 1.25a (05Sep02) Released
- Fix unitialized stack variable in bextract so it
  will always read the currently mounted tape.

2002-09-04 Version 1.25 (01Sep02) Released
  General:
- Added .cvsignore files in each directory to cut down on the
  CVS output when scanning directories and finding Makefiles
  and such which are not part of the CVS tree.

  Changes submitted this submission:
- Cleaned up a lot of the error messages in Verify, including
  indenting.
- Had to remove some of the "automatic" error message printing
  in the DB because they are in fact things that come up 
  for Verify but not really errors.


  2002-08-30 Version 1.25 (30Aug02) Beta
  From kes30Aug02
- Fixed a bug where only the first file was restored if
  it is hard linked. The other links were lost.
- In some cases of restoring to alternate directories, softlinks
  were not properly restored.

  From kes28Aug02
  General:
- Bacula backups now run up to 12 times faster than version 1.24
- Bacula can run multiple simultaneous Jobs.
- Had to turn off TRANSACTIONS in SQLite because it doesn't work
  with multiple simultaneous jobs (I'm working on this).
- Added a better Job printout for Restore Jobs.
- Added a save/restore Rate to backup and restore jobs. This
  does not yet subtract out operator wait time so it will be
  underestimated it the Job waits on the tape (mount/label).
- Fixed a major bug caused by free()ing a buffer twice in
  the Restore code. This made the SD more or less useless after
  any restore Job. Arrggg!
- DIR - SD protocol changed, both must be updated at the same time.
- DIR - FD protocol changed in upward compatible way. Upgrade of   
  FD not required, but recommended.

  Changes submitted this submission:
- Added bell to "make" when errors are detected.
- Changed default compile option from -g to -g -O2
- Additional documentation as usual -- much based on questions or
  feedback from users. Thanks.
- Fixed example config files to use new syntax and to have a 
  Restore Job.
- Define ETIME to ETIMEOUT for Irix
- Added JCR filed to DB structure permitting direct printing error
  messages from within the Database subroutines.
  Some error messages may be printed twice as a consequence.
  When I see them or someone reports them, I will remove the double.
- Added JCR to the bsock structure. This allows direct printing
  of network errors from within the network code.
- Made most "trivial" debug messages have level 100 or greater. This
  allows for easier debugging of new code using the range below 100.
- Began replacing all Emsg() with Jmsg() using a NULL as the JCR in    
  Jmsg() is the same as Emsg().
- Fixed several crashes in the Director because of malformed config files.
- Added SpoolAttributes to Job resource.
- Pass CatalogFiles to SD. If set to no, the attributes are dropped 
  within the SD rather than being sent to the DIR.
- Cleaned up a number of information/error messages in user interface.
  This includes eliminating the "pretty please" response in favor of
  "yes/no" to delete volumes and pools.
- Cleaned up quite a number of uninitialized variables reported when going
  to -O2, most were harmless, but a couple could cause problems.
- The cd command in restore was not working correctly (it didn't allow some
  legal cds).
- Fixed a segmentation violation in the directory tree handling code in 
  the restore command.
- Handle a few error conditions in the restore command better.
- Permit "Where" to be set to nul in modification of a run command.
- Clarified the error message for Verify if an InitCatalog has not previously
  been done -- thanks Chuck.
- Add MaximumConcurrentJobs to FD.
- Added code to mem_pool to die if a buffer is released twice.
- Lots of work done on SD for multiple simultaneous jobs. Split device.c
  into device.c, mount.c and acquire.c
- Started writing new lock code for SD, but may back it out -- needs more
  thought. Current code works, but is too complicated. Maybe can simplify it.
- Cleaned up the SD tools code quite a bit. Added bootstrap to all tools.
- Ensure that tape session labels are not split across two blocks. This makes
  reading them back much easier.
- Fixed another restore bug concerning tape labels on multi-volume saves.

=============================================================================
2002-08-14 Version 1.24
  From kes12Aug02
- Made a new tools directory.
- Moved smtp into the tools directory.
- Created a dbcheck program in the tools directory that
  checks for certain database errors and if requested fixes them.
- Put the database link flags on DB_LIBS so that it now only is
  on binaries that actually need it.
- Document dbcheck and testfind programs.
- Move testfind to tools directory.
- Check for FileSet after getting Client name in Restore command.
  Modify all necessary SQL commands to accept FileSetId.
- Add a db_get_fileset_record in cats directory.
- Correct list last 20 files concatenation to be MySQL 
  dependent. They aren't SQL standard. Use SQL standard || for
  other SQL programs.
- Modify dir command in file selection to produce a long form
  listing of the file/directory name.
- Add platforms/irix/*.in files to CVS
- Make Console command scanner accept quoted value fields.
- If after selecting Client to restore, there are multiple
  FileSets, ask user to select one.
- After obtaining JobIds for restore, ensure that there is only
  one MediaType, and select a Storage resource to be used.

  From kes11Aug02
- Made restore actually work.
- Made console and gconsole be configured (requested by Chuck)
- Updated kernstodo
- changed fs in Job record to fileset for clarity
- The console run command was not properly picking up the command
  line arguments.  Fixed!
- Changed add/remove/rm to mark/unmark
- Volume keyword VolumeName was wrong, changed to Volume (in restore bsr).
- Pass jcr to parse_bsr, and if non-NULL, it will output error messages
  to Job stream rather than Emsg.
- Modified lexical scanner to include caller context so that jcr can
  be stored in lex context allowing error messages to be properly 
  routed.
- Renamed the Job message chain to be jcr_msgs. This eliminated the      
  previous confusion with the default value, now named jcr->messages.
- Implemented multi-volume bsr records.    
- Implemented pm_strcat() and pm_strcpy() to cat/add to memory pool
  buffers in same way as strcat/strcpy, but expanding buffer.
- Modified db_get_volume_names to handle arbitrarily long Volume list.

  From kes07Aug02
- If the Console program terminated during the printing of messages,
  the message file was left locked. This was corrected by using the
  new read-write lock code.  
- Implemented Pw() and Vw() for obtaining and releasing a write lock
  using the rwl_xxx routines.
- Deleted some old pthread_mutex code from mysql.c
- In making the Irix port, I previously corrected the base64 routine so 
  they were not sensitive to the machine definition of char. This made
  them incompatible with previous versions invalidating MD5 signatures
  which are in base64 format. I have now corrected this, making the
  routines compatible with the previous version but also insensitive
  to the default definition of char.
- Removed some unnecessary NPRT() usage in signal.c (pointed out by
  the Irix compiler).
- Add back BNET_NONO for compatibility with older File daemons.
- Implement runing a restore Job in the restore command.
- Make installation of query.sql unconditional. To prevent you own file
  from being overwritten, give it a different name.
- Made parse_command_args() in ua take command from ua->cmd, this
  simplifies it and allows usage in other places -- e.g. building
  arguments for created run command in restore.
- Cleaned the naming of s_full_ctx to be s_jobids.
- Write the bsr created in restore to "working-directory"/restore.bsr
- Fix bugs in command line scanner in run command -- also some misplaced
  breaks!
- Eliminate static cmd in ua_server.c
- Eliminate segmentation fault when using the Run command in the
  Console -- forgot to init_msgs().

  From kes06Aug02
- Did a good amount of documentation.
- Added sql_cmds.c to CVS, forgot, pointed out by Chuck.
- Added new platforms/irix directory to CVS
- Turn off transaction debug code in sql.c
- Reworked the scheduler so that it handles the same Job starting
  twice in the same hour. Previously it took one or the other.
- Tightened up the "slop" in the timings that I programmed to ensure
  that the same job isn't run twice or that no job was missed.
- Increase the sleep time.
- Used job_type_to_str() in status so that Admin jobs are correctly reported.
- Add internationalization message chars to a number of routines
  in util.c
- Make the watchdog timer clear the mutex when it exits.
- Some tweaks to the Restore command. It needs fixing when a Job spans
  two or more volumes.

  From kes05Aug02
- Initial cut at adding Irix File daemon support.
- Lots of work on the restore command.
- Take a stab at eliminating the "broken pipe message"
  when the console program prematurely terminates.
- Reimplemented transactions for SQLite by keeping
  them all in the same thread.
- quit in the Console program now waits for Bacula to
  quit. To immediately quit, you must enter .quit
- Eliminated BNET_EOF -- this COULD have some negative consequences
  on interdaemon communications.
- Define Job termination status for Admin jobs.
- Write new bstrncpy() function that guarantees that strcpy is
  properly terminated.
- Fixed command input in ua_input.c to accept quoted items as a
  single field. 

  From kes01Aug02
- The changes that added indexes to the SQLite database were
  lost -- thanks to Chuck for pointing this out. Redone.
- Fixed a problem quoting strings in SQLite. This showed up
  as database errors with files containing ' or " in the filename.
- Implemente restore command -- still in progress.
- Added indexes to all fields in SQLite that exist in MySQL.
- Moved unused immortal files from src/lib to src/immortal.
  This will permit splitting depkgs.
- Started work on adding embedded MySQL. Cannot get the tables
  to work for the moment. Please don't try to use this option.
- Convert to using single quotes for enclosing all strings.
- Implement correct quoting algorithm for SQLite strings.
  Is dequoting needed?
- Started centralizing SQL statments in the Director in sql_cmds.c
- Changed a number of M_ABORTs to M_ERROR_TERM so that program terminates
  but does not produce a dump.
- Allow wild-card matches in bsr for Client name, and Job.
- Change OflineOnUnmount=no as default.
- Fixed improper printing of filenames containing a space in bls.c
  Thanks to Carlos for reporting this.

===========================================================================
2002-07-26 Release 1.23a
- Fix segmentation fault is FD status.
- Turn off TRANSACTIONs for SQLite.                        

===========================================================================
2002-07-23 Release 1.23
  From kes22Jul02
- Updated Bacula to handle some minor differences in MySQL 4.0.2
  (still works with older MySQLs).
- Updated MySQL documentation to correct some minor errors.
- Added kernstodo to CVS
- Fixed create_mysql_database, which I recently accidently broke.
- Disallow zero length volume names in Console program.
- Create alter_mysql_tables and alter_sqlite_tables for conversion
  from 1.22 table format to 1.23 table format.

  From kes20Jul02
- Investigation of SQLite performace problems reported by Chuck.
- Updated ChangeLog
- Updated README
- made root@localhost the default email address because many smtp
  servers reject root but accept root@localhost
- Added an autochangers chapter to the manual.
- Documented most of the new features in 1.23
- Modified the SQLite interface code to start a transaction at the
  beginning of a job and commit it at the end of the job. It
  also commits it after 10000 changes. Hopefully this will
  improve performance.
- Set the default cache pages from 2000 to 10000 for SQLite (i.e.
  about 15Megs of memory) hoping to improve performance.
- Terminate last filename referenced in FD prior to copy to
  avoid race problem with multiple threads and no locking.
- Enhanced the status output to include the JobType                
- Print an error message if the email program terminates in error.
- If your machine has an MTUNLOCK, do it before doing an OFFLINE to
  ensure that the door is unlocked.
- Added code to stored/append.c to spool attributes. This is in
  a testing stage and must be explicitly enabled.
- Added a no_attributes variable to stored/append.c that prevents
  the attributes from being sent to the Director. As yet, no way
  to turn it on.
- Modified SQLite code so that after 10000 updates any transaction
  is committed, then restarted. This keeps it from using too much
  memory.
- Set the default cache size to 10000 pages (previously 2000).
- Fixed a segmentation fault on Sun due to no default value for
  the JobStatus.
- Added the same indexes to SQLite that I exist in MySQL. This
  VASTLY reduces CPU usage for lots of inserts.
- Added spooling to bnet_send().

  From kes18Jul02
- The following two changes were prompted by questions/suggestions
  from A Morgan.
- If you have "AlwaysOpen = no" in your SD Device
  resource, Bacula will free() the drive when it
  is finished with the Job.
- If you have "Offline On Unmount = yes", in your
  SD Device resource, Bacula will offline (or eject)
  the tape prior to freeing it.
- Added Maximum Open Wait to allow open() to wait if drive is busy.
- Added RunBeforeJob and RunAfterJob records to Job records.
  This permits running an external program with the following editing
  codes:
    %% = %
    %c = Client's name
    %d = Director's name
    %i = JobId
    %e = Job Exit
    %j = Job
    %l = Job Level
    %n = Job name
    %t = Job type

  From kes17Jul02
- Added autochanger support to devices.c
- Allow user to change Slot in the Volume record.
- Implemented code in lib to run an external program
  (tape changer)
- Implemented a changer script for mtx.
- Currently the changer commands used are:  
    loaded -- returns number of slot loaded or 0
    load   -- loads a specified slot
    unload -- unloads the device (returns casette to slot)
- Other changer commands defined but not yet used:
    list   -- returns list of slots containing a cassette
    slots  -- returns total number of slots 
- Implemented ChangerCommand, specified in the SD Device
  resource, permits editing of:
      %% = %
      %a = archive device name
      %c = changer device name
      %f = Client's name
      %j = Job name
      %o = command
      %s = Slot base 0
      %S = Slot base 1
      %v = Volume name
- Implemented MaximumChangerWait default 120 seconds. It is 
  specified in the SD Device resource.

  From kes15Jul02
- Moved techlogs from main directory to be subdirectory of doc
- Added code for strerror_r, and detection of gethostbyname_r().
- The protocol between the Director and the SD has changed.
- Major rework of SD tape mounting to prepare for Changer commands.
- Separated Update Media record and Create JobMedia record. These
  are done from the SD by calling the Director. Need separate Create
  JobMedia so that when a Job spans a volume, all other Jobs writing
  the same volume will also have JobMedia records created.
- Added message to user indicating selection aborted if he enters .
  to a Console selection request.
- Create a jobstatus_to_ascii() routine for use in status commands.
  This makes a single routine from three separate pieces of code.
  Updated the code to properly handle more (all) termination statuses.
- Tried to fix the gnome-console to handle history a bit better. There
  are still some problems with focus not being properly set to the edit
  box after history replacement.
- Removed the shutdown() from bnet_close() hoping to fix Console termination
  errors that are occassionally seen -- no luck.
- Moved add_str() to lib/util and renamed it add_str_to_pool_mem() so that
  it can be used to edit Job termination codes and Changer command codes.
- Reworked how the SD mounts tapes (in device.c) so that control passes through
  only a single routine. The logic is much simpler than previously, and now
  adding AutoChanger code is straight forward.
- Made SD tape mounting much more fault tolerant -- more cases retry instead
  of terminating the Job.
- Wrote code to edit_device_codes() for Changer commands. Not yet fully     
  implemented.
- Added a ChangerDevice directive to the Device resource. Still need to add
  ChangerCommand.

  From kes07Jul02
- This documents what I did while on vacation. 
- A fair amount of documentation.
- Implemented Verify Volume to Catalog (needs renaming)
- Modified the database to include new MarkId field as
  well as Counters. Database level is incremented from 1 to  2.
- Added first cut of managing autochangers by implementing Slot in DB.
- Fixed a good number of M_ERROR messages to be M_FATAL where appropriate.
  Also converted a number of Emsg() to Jmsg() permitting better Job error
  messages.
- First cut at implementing a general packet passing mechanism for bsock
  to replace printf and sscanf for passing data.     
- Made make_xxx_tables and drop_xxx_tables and create_xxx_database
  for bdb as well as sqlite. With this each database has the
  same set of scripts (with the exception that MySQL has grant_privileges).
- Modified Makefile to only install the database scripts for the
  database that you are using.
- Updated the pdf script to include all the html files.
- Did quite a lot of documentation.
- Made Bacula compile correctly with DEBUG turned off.
- Implemented Pmsg() macros that permit using the debug print
  routines even with DEBUG off.
- Updated job_cancelled() macro to handle JS_FatalError.
- Changed db_find_last_full_verify() to db_find_last_jobid(). This
  permits working with Verify Volume to Catalog.
- Removed TRANSACTION code from incrementing NextId for SQLite. 
- Implemented quick and dirty (not fully functional code) so that
  console program does not die if ctl-Z is entered. 
- Cleaned up backup.c a bit adding a bail_out goto to ensure proper
  handling of errors with minimum code.
- Added passing Slot back and forth to Storage daemon with Volume info.
- Implemented Slot in Media record in DB.
- Implemented first cut of Counter resource in dird_conf.c. A counter
  resource is part of the Pool resource.
- Implemented necessary database record. However, the resource doesn't
  yet create a DB record.
- Implemented onefs (One File System) and recurse options on Include
  resource.
- Implemented autopruning of Verify and Restore Jobs.
- Did a better job of calculating thread_concurrency() for Sun systems.
  This permits better multi-threading allowing all the threads to run
  at the same time.
- Implemented a wait_for_storage_daemon_termination(), which is used by
  backup and verify volume.
- Clarified a number of UA prompts, and add feedback where certain commands
  completed but printed nothing. (More work to be done here).
- Added a pile of new code to implement Verify Volume to Catalog. It is sort
  of a hybrid of "restore" and "verify" in that it actually reads the tape,
  then compares it to the catalog.  Need Verify Volume to Client.
- Added a good number of checks for job_cancelled() this should permit
  quicker and more reliable cancelling of jobs.
- Fixed one bug in restore where I used ofile instead of lname, which means
  that if the lname was too long, the memory was not properly reallocated.
- Cleaned up find_one.c in findlib quite a bit.
- Link smtp static so that it works even if the libraries are messed up.
- If mail host is not found, retry with local host in smtp.
- Added slot and stream to the bootstrap record processing.
- Do offline on tape cartrige for unmount command. This can be turned off
  by the user in the config file. OffLineOnUnmount in Device resource.
- Implemented AutoChanger = yes/no in Device resource.

===========================================================================
2002-07-07 Release 1.22
- All the basic Restore code to handle the boostrap file is
  now implemented with the exception of the Console Restore command.
- Retained compatibility with previous Restore providing no 
  bootstrap file is specified. However, the old code (JobId based)
  will go away in a future release.
- Fixed a number of segmentation faults in the Console program due
  to printing of NULL pointers -- thanks to Chuck and his Sun for
  finding and reporting them -- mostly in ua_output.c.

  From kes25Jun02
- Null pointers now are printed as *None* if NPRT() is used.
- At the request of Phil, all resources are now chained in in the
  order they appear in the config file.
- Implement Bootstrap record in the Director's config file, which
  allows you to specify a predefined bootstrap file for Restore Jobs.
- Allow Bootstrap on the Restore record. This is deprecated.
- Implemented code to pass the Bootstrap file, if defined, to the
  File daemon, then from the File daemon to the Storage daemon.
- Added ability to set Bootstrap file in the Console when running a Restore.
- Allow scan_error() routine to be passed to lex_open_file(). This permits
  using lex in the Storage daemon without worrying that it will ABORT on
  a syntax error.  More work is needed to direct the error messages correctly.
- Improved error messages a bit when config syntax errors are found.
- Tested and corrected some errors in match_bsr.c
- Removed askdir.c from bls and bextract by defining dummy entry points.
- bextract now has bootstrap pretty well integrated.
- Changed bextract ABORTs into FATAL and exit(1) or ERROR_TERMINATE.
  More user friendly.
- Eliminated at least one lld and replaced it by edit_uint64() 
- Eliminated a few more _PROTO()s.
- Corrected a problem with the SQL for in query.sql for 
  Listing Volumes to Restore All Files

  From kes22Jun02
- Additional documentation.
- Reduce the time the jcr mutex is locked in lib/jcr.c
- More null pointer printing fixes in lib/parse_conf.c (debug output only).
- Added daemon filename to Kaboom message so I know what daemon died.
- Fix big bad bug introduced in watchdog.c last update that caused
  a segmentation violation (forgot to check for NULL pointer).
- Add a bit more info to bad returns from Stored when starting
  a job fails.

  From kes21Jun02
- Fixed scan_to_eol
- Fixed backup scanning forgot one T_STRING -> T_UNQUOTED_STRING
- changed all rwlock_t to brwlock_t to avoid conflicts with
  Solaris library.
- Added NPRT() macro to allow printing of NULL pointers, which
  segment fault on Solaris.
- Cast printing of pid_t to int for Solaris compiler.

  From kes20Jun02
- Added expect argment to lex_get_token().
- Added tree.c and tree.h to lib directory.

  From kes19Jun02
- Improvements to the bootstrap compiler
- Implemented first cut of bootstrap code in the Storage daemon
- Modified the authentication code to be more explicit during 
  failures.
- Added a few more debug message numbers with more arguments (Dmsg10, ...)
- Added more and more precise error messages when authentication fails.
- Implemented new "expect" codes in the lexical scanner that allows
  the caller to specify what he wants.                   
- Added integer, positive integer, 64 bit integer, and integer ranges,
  and name scanning to lex.
- Implemented new lex code in parse_conf.c, this reduces significantly
  the code.
- Hopefully fixed a watchdog race bug that caused the watchdog to time
  out a line after 1 hour rather than 6 days.

  From kes15Jun02
- Implemented a Bootstrap file parser and matcher.
- Implemented first cut of bootstrap code in bextract  
- Started clarifying different termination codes.
- Added M_ERROR_TERM to immediately terminate the daemon -- no dump.
  Also changed a few termination codes as appropriate.
- Fixed create_jobmedia_record() to include all the fields such as
  StartFile/EndFile, StartBlock/EndBlock.
- Print user friendly message when query mode ends.
- Fixed ls style print routines (bextract, bls, restore) to check
  buffer size, to print the link if any, and to used edit_uint64()
  instead of %lld.
- Moved scan_to_eol() and s_err() to lex.c to avoid dragging in 
  parse_conf.c for new bsr scanning code.
- New files: bsr.h, parse_bsr.c and match_bsr.c. parse_bsr.c parses
  a Bootstrap file, and match_bsr.c matches a bsr against a tape.
- use strcasecmp() in several places instead of lcase().
- Add first cut of bootstrap to bextract.
- Added File Size limit -- writes EOF after limit exeeded.

===========================================================================
2002-06-12 Release 1.21
- Fixed several problems with filenames being truncated if
  they contain spaces. Thanks to the user that reported this.
- N.B. To get the new queries, after the "make" and 
  "make install" you must explicitly replace the
  existing query.sql by query.sql.new.  query.sql is a
  user configuration file, so it is not overwritten.
- Added GZIP compression of Included files.  
- Added additional fields to tape SOS record permitting better
  recovery with no database.
- Be sure to remove any !terminate statements you may have
  in your config files.
- MUST UPDATE ALL DAEMONS due to protocol change to handle new
  tape format.

  From kes11Jun02:
- Updated examples directory with my most recent config files.
- Modified the M_TERM meaning to mean that Bacula has
  terminated in error without producing a dump. Previously,
  it meant that Bacula terminate (with or without error).
  You should remove any !terminate from your messages
  resources.
- Changed the order of the libraries in the link so that
  tcp wrappers link properly. Thanks Phil for reporting this.
- A user reported that filenames containing spaces were truncated
  in bextract. This was indeed the case. They were also truncated
  in Restore as well as in Verify. They are, hopefully, all fixed
  now.
- Made a few error conditions in Verify non-fatal.
- Modified the Console "query" command to permit multiple SQL
  statements per command. 
- Implemented three new "query" options: 
    List last 10 Full Backups for a Client
    List Volumes used by selected JobId
    List Volumes to Restore All Files
  To use them, simply type "query" to the Console program, and
  select the one you want.
- Modified bextract to default to extracting all files (i.e. /).
- Cleaned up the code in bextract a bit.

  From kes03Jun02:
- Improve Verify command to include files examined.
- Eliminate fcntl() locking of the console file and replaced
  it with a pthreads mutex.
- Note Director - SD protocol is changed to handle new tape
  information (Fileset, JobType, JobLevel).
- Create config.out that contains a summary of ./configure
  to see what you previously configured: "cat config.out"
- Implemented GZIP compression.  Added addition syntax to
  Include { } resource to permit setting of any GZIP compression
  level:
     compression=GZIP
     compression=GZIP1
     ...
     compression=GZIP9

  Level 1 is minimum compression and level 9 is maximum. Using just
  GZIP gives the default (level 6).
- Enhanced the tape format to include the unique Job name, FileSetName,
  JobType, and JobLevel in the Start/End of Session records. The code
  detects that tape level difference and acts accordingly. You can 
  add data in the new format to old tapes.
- Fixed an incorrect display message in the prune command.
- Began implementation of Verify Volume and Verify Data.
- Cleaned up File daemon restore.c a bit ensuring that termination 
  cleanup is done and all possible Emsgs are converted to Jmsgs.
- Modify bls.c to use common setup routines. This reduced the big
  code duplication that creeped in when I added different listing
  options. Also, changing tapes is now handled uniformily in a subroutine.

===========================================================================
2002-05-27 Release 1.20
- Started documenting Catalog Pruning and Recycling.
  Added catmaintenance.html and recycling.html
- Fixed the query command bug.
- Implemented PID files to prevent two copies of Bacula
  from running at the same time. Be sure you --with-pid-dir
  points to a working directory.
- Modified ASSERT() to cause a segmentation violation. This
  permits a core dump.
- Worked on gnome-console. It paints better, it tells you if it
  is ready to accept a command or processing one, and it is
  almost entirely GTK+ (rather than GNOME, I'm removing GNOME
  a bit at a time).
- Limit to 100 the number of tape labeling errors in a single Job.
- Add some additional ASSERT()s to the database routines. I don't
  like ASSERTs but they do catch bugs.
- Tested and debugged recycling of Volumes.  Needed to change
  the Director-SD protocol slightly.
- Removed the experimental SIGHUP in the Director as it is a
  potential source of errors.
- Added Level, Pool, Messages, and Storage keyword/value scanning
  to the Schedule Run record.
- Improved printing of Schedule resources with "show schedules"
- Do not autoprune Jobs/Files if the Job errs.
- Updated newvol() to pass back the updated Media record.   
- Fixed the "update pool" command, which was broken during a much
  earlier code reorganization.
- Improved a few of the pruning messages.
- Removed readline inclusions from gnome-console (hang over from console).
- Make Jmsg use daemon message handler if no message handler is defined.
  This is always the case in the SD and FD.
- Started removing __PROTO(). With C++ prototypes are manditory, so why
  keep around legacy code.
- Added a good deal of message internationalization -- more to be done.
- Move cached Path into mdb structure and use POOLMEM.
- Fix verify bug introduced last update causing incorrect diffs 
  by turning off autopruning.
- Started adding code to distinguish Errors from Fatal Errors.
- Errors are now counted in message.c for a Job.
- More POOLMEM cleanups.
- Implemented Automatic pruning.
- Implemented Automatic recycling of Volumes.
- Added PruneJobs/Files/Volumes=yes or no to Job resource. If set,
  it forces the specified pruning.
- Modified rwlock to accept multiple nested write lock
  requests.
- Modified the cats directory to use the new rwlock mechanism
  in place of P() and V(). 
- Defined db_lock(mdb) and db_unlock(mdb). They are in effect
  transaction locks. 
- Add CVS Id's to most files.
- Made first cut at AutoPrune
- Added new autoprune file that is called at the end of
  each Job. It then decides when and what to prune and
  calls the UA prune routines.
- Modified Run (in Schedule resource) to permit overrides of
  Level, Pool, Storage, and Messages. (not tested).
- Added more POOLMEM in place of char.
- Implemented daemon pid files. This prevents multiple 
  daemons from running simultaneously. You can run multiple
  daemons if they listen on different ports.
- Documented the Schedule resource a bit better.
- Began gently adding a POOLMEM type (perviously void).
  For the moment it is a #define to char, but long term
  it should be its own typedef.
- Corrected a bit of spacing on the status bar of gnome-console
- Added Admin and Archive Job types.
- Implemented multiple Messages resources. Each daemon has
  its own message resource, which defaults if not defined.
  Jobs may now have different message handlers.
- Cleaned up a bit of duplicate code in backup, verify, and
  restore by creating appropriate subroutines in job.c
- Added Type, Client, FileSet, and Level resource record
  definitions to the Director. These can be used in place
  of the Backup = ..., Verify = ..., ... commands.  This needs
  documenting.
- Corrected an incorrect message in the prune code and added
  the number of Files pruned in the message.
- Corrected several paint problems with gnome-console.
- Added a bit of printout in signal handler during traceback.
- Cleaned up most of sm_check() to be turned on/off by define
  in version.h

===========================================================================
2002-05-10 Release 1.19
- Allow the user to select a new period for pruning.
- Lots of additions to the manual -- prune and purge
  commands documented.
- Applied Phil's configure.in fix for --prefix, ...
- Fixed bug found by Phil (patch supplied) in updating
  MD5 signatures (revert to 32 bit FileId, move "static"
  variables into JCR) (catreq.c fd-cmds.c).
- Reverted to using INTEGER for FileId in make_sql_tables
  due to a bug in MySQL.
- Change editing code to %d for FileId.
- Remove sqlite in make distclean in cats directory.
- Remove console.conf in console during make distclean.
- Remove gnome-console.conf during make distclean.
- Remove bacula-dir.conf during make distclean.
- Set default level when using Console if none specified.
  Bug reported by Phil.
- A simple . command from Console is ignored.   
- Change program named from filed to bacual-fd in winmain.cpp
- Change default config file for Win32 in winmain.cpp
- Free namebuf on early return from find_one.c. Bug reported by Phil.

- Removed terabytes from parse_conf.c because of problems with
  older gcc compilers.
- Turn off gnome options in gnome-console by constructing empty argv.
- Fixes to Verify when only MD5 differs.
- Insert 0 for MD5 as default rather than space.
- Allow .messages "transparent" command while reading input
  in UserAgent server.
- In dird/verify.c ensure that correct filename is printed if only
  the MD5 differs. Minor reindenting caused large diff.
- Delete unused code from backup.c
- In filed/verify.c ensure that same algorithm as backup.c is used
  to pass back MD5 signatures -- especially for directories and files
  that cannot be read. Change dummy filename from X to *MD5-id*.
  This dummy value should never be printed.
- Make gnome-console poll Director every 5 seconds for output.
  This means that queued up messages are displayed at reasonable
  intervals. Delete some unused code hanging around from the tty
  console program.
- Begin implementation of prune commands.
- Add command line history to gnome-console. Not yet saved across sessions.
- Fixed some broken URLs in the manual.
- Added JobId type.
- Wrote first cut of "prune files" and "prune jobs".
- Added command line history to gnome-console 2500 lines max.
- Widened store_time() and associated variables to 64 bits using
  new btime_t definition.
- Removed GNOME about box and replaced it with 
  a somewhat crude Gtk+ about box in the gnome-console.
- Widened StartDay in the Job DB record to be 64 bits.
- Changed edit_uint_ to edit_uint64_ everywhere. Much more
  descriptive of what is done.
- Removed most llds and replaced them with %s and edit_uint64.
  This makes the code a bit easier to read for beginners.
- Added a btime_t typedef which is 64 bits wide.
- Added most of the code needed to do Purge and Prune of
  database. Not yet tested. Please do not use.
- Additional config options for Console.
- Started adding code for Automatic Recycling of Volumes.
- Allow arbitrary length filenames in Verify code.
- Fix incorrect filename in Verify code.
- Significant enhancement to number scanning in config parser.
- Requires initializing MySQL tables, or applying cats/alter.sql
  to modify Media table.
- Modified Makefile to printer a much more visible
  message if the make ends in error.
- Added the Purge value to the VolStatus in the Media table.
  This value is set if the Volume is purged.
- Enhanced the db_delete_media_record() routine to delete
  all associated records in the database.
- Modified Console to always write to the variable "output"       
  rather than stdout. This will permit directing output to a file.
- Enhanced the Console configuration file to have a Console 
  resource. This will allow us to add an rcfile and history file.
- Modified Find_next_vol in catreq.c to search for "Recycle"
  volumes if there are none marked Append. Also made Get_Vol_info
  return the VolStatus to the Storage daemon.
- Allow upper/lower case match on job level names.
- Added another warning message to the Console "delete media" command.
- Corrected a number of FileId types from uint64_t to FileId_t in
  ua_retention.c.
- In ua server close database before freeing JCR (because pointer is
  kept in ua and jcr structures).
- parse all numbers as doubles. Do lots of checking for valid number
  formats. Allow numbers in scientific form (e.g. 1.5e+10).
- Remove terabyte modifier as it doesn't work in some compilers.
- Fix bug in handling some modifiers.
- Added all necessary code for Recycle to Storage daemon. A Volume
  marked Recycle will now be overwritten.
- Filled out the prune command a bit and did some testing.
- Make console accept redirected input.
- Altered the Table definitions to include Recycle,
  FileRetention, JobRetention, and AutoPrune.
- Widened StartDay to 64 bits.
- Use JobId_t in more places. 
- Added the new table fields to the database record definitions.
- Changed Recycle from string to a binary quantity.
- Added a Version table with a VersionId to detect.
  future changes in the database. This should prevent
  a Bacula from working with a database that is not in sync.
- Modify Console to accept input from a file. This will permit
  the .read command and allow reading a .rc file.
- Added new retention and recycle variables to the Director's configuration.
- The UA subroutines or commands can now be called from core
  code because the output routines detect the absence of a 
  UA socket and direct output to the Job.
- Added a verbose flage to the ua packet to permit reduction of
  output while running a UA command (prune) from a Job.
- Did a fair amount of work on the prune command. Prune Volume now works.
- Purge Volume now works.
- Made last changes for integrating prune and purge commands.
- Add -ltermcap to CONS_LIBS when readline is configured.
  More work to be done to search for termcap.
- Added cats/drop_sqlite_tables.in, which will delete the SQLite database.
- Got CWEB working so that we can compile filesys.w and immortal.w
- Modified depkgs to include cweb.             
- Note, CWEB is not yet used by the core Bacula code.
- Made cats/alter.sql, which alters an old database to bring it
  up to the new format. This only works with MySQL since SQLite does
  not have the ALTER SQL command.
- Changed the old StartDay field in the db to be JobTDate, which is
  the latest time/date in widened Unix time format that the Job ran.
  This value is used when doing pruning.
- Added code in cats/sql.c to verify that the database internal version
  corresponds to the db version compiled in Bacula. It is set to 1 currently.
- Lots of changes to cats to bring the SQL up to date with the new 
  retention period changes.
- Added Console command code to permit changing a Volume's retention period.
- Removed old code that used date_encode() and replaced it with widened
  Unix time().
- Started modifying Message resource scanner so that we can have multiple
  message resources. Much more work to be done.
- Moved scanning for time into new library routine string_to_btime().

===========================================================================
2002-04-22 Release 1.18
- Applied Phil's configure.in fix for --prefix, ...

  argv.

===========================================================================
2002-04-18 Release 1.17 Kern Sibbald
- Ensure that platforms Makefiles are called for clean  
  and distclean.
- Hide a lot of Makefile messages with @
- Applied Phil's configure.in patch. Thanks.
- Doc updates, many to clarify points brought up by Phil.
- Applied Phil's make_mysql_tables.in patch. Thanks.
- Made authenticate.c in dird test bnet_send status.
- Make label a bit more friendly with extra info message.
- Add level 200 to debug info in run command.
- Remove old code from findlib/testfind.c so that it compiles.
- Add two minute max wait to cram-md5 authentication. Hopefully,
  this will catch non-responding WinNT daemons.
- Allow time and size modifiers to be upper or lower case.
- Turn off old CYGWIN patch for pthread_cond_timedwait() bug that
  now causes File daemon hangs on WinNT.
- Fix mount messages for restore. Previous updates to save
  broke the restore code.
- By default write fixed block sizes rather than variable block
  sizes.  My Sony DAT simply does not work (reread failures) with
  variable block sizes.
- Data split across tapes was not being correctly restored
  (at least on DAT tapes). 
- Implement MaximumBlockSize and MinumBlockSize statements in
  Storage daemon so user can specify variable block sizes if
  desired.
- Return error if block checksum error on read (previously 
  ignored).
- Fixed some error messages in bls, and in some cases exit(1)
  rather than ABORT. There remain ABORTs to be examined.
- Made a local copy of tcpd.h and corrected the function 
  prototype problem for C++.

===========================================================================
2002-04-14 First public release 1.16 Kern Sibbald
 - Many intervening changes/updates.

2001-09-29 Release 1.0 Kern Sibbald
 - Fixes to problems found at John's
   installation.
 - See techlogs/kes25Sep01 for details

2001-09-25 Release 1.0 Kern Sibbald
 - Helped John install at his site.
   He is backing up one Linux machine and
   one Win2000 machine.

2001-mm-dd Many releases
 - Released internally.
  
2000-04-09 Release 0.4 Kern Sibbald
 - Added a lot of Director configuration code. In      
   part (a small part), the Director now uses the
   bacula.conf file to know what to do. There still
   remains a lot to do.
 - The file search code is now integrated into the
   MySQL database routines, and Bacula is now hooked
   into the MySQL database (if so configured). Thus
   all the database records are being created, though
   there still remains some work in getting all the
   details into the records (such as the Storage 
   coordinates).
 - I've defined how Volume pools work (see manual).
 - I've defined error message handling though no code
   is yet written.
 - The following resources and records are implemented
   in the Director configuration file (bacula.conf):
    
   Director
     Name (passed to Storage daemon)
   Client
     Name, Address, Port
     Password (not yet used)
   Storage    
     Name, Address, Port, Password, MediaType
   Job
     Name    
     Type (not yet used)
     Backup (only one permitted) 
       Client, FileSet
     Storage
     Schedule, Messages, Pool (not used)
   FileSet
     Name  
     Include (options ignored)
     Exclude (no options)
   Schedule (not used)
     Name
   Messages (not used)
     Name       
     Debug, syslog, mail, append (not used)
   Catalog
     Name
     Address, Port, Password (not used)
   Pool (not used)
     Name
     PoolType, MediaType (not used)

 - Added Storage configuration routines.
   Director
     Name, password (verified against those sent by Director)
   Storage
     Name, Address, Port (address, port must correspond to Director's values)
     Password, MediaType
   Device
     Name, MediaType (must correspond to those sent by Director)
     Archive Device (defines device name)


2000-03-10 Release 0.3 Kern Sibbald
 - Implemented new base64 encoding for attributes.
   This eliminates some of the error messages in the
   sprintfs on the Solaris due to different stat() sizes.
 - Implemented  the first cut of the file search routines for
   the File daemon.  The exclusion lists work including wild
   cards.   There is a lot of work to be done, but the basic
   structure is now in place (wild cards do not yet work for
   the include).
 - Completed writing the memory pool code.  Now I must
   implement it in the daemons.
 - Modified the bacula start/stop script so that it has a
   better chance of working on SGI and Solaris.
 - The catalog code has not been converted to the new file
   search code.

2000-03-06 Release 0.2 Kern Sibbald
 - Integrated John's fixes.
 - Made Makefiles self configuring when Makefile.in is changed.
 - Added a runit script in the top level that runs bacula
 - Added a "bacula" script in the top level directory that
   starts and stops the File daemon and the Storage daemon.

2000-03-03 Release 0.1 Kern Sibbald
 - Basic Director, File, and Storage daemons.
   Standalone Catalog services using MySQL

2000-01-22 Kern Sibbald
   * Setup basic file structure with ./configure
