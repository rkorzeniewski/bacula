# This file provides information about the External dependencies required by
# Bacula.
#
# There are four fields delimited by |.  Only the first two fields are 
# required.  The other two are used when the top level directory of the
# archive is not the same as the file name with any suffixes removed.
#
# Field 1 is the name of the dependency.  It is used to define the
# name of the three variables which are assigned the values of fields 2 to 4.
#
# Field 2 is the URL of the archive.  It is assigned to the variable
# URL_[field1].
#
# Field 3 is the top directory of the archive or the name of a directory that
# must be created and the archive extracted into it.  It is assigned to the 
# variable DIR_[field1].
#
# Field 4 indicates if the directory specified in field 3 must be created 
# first and the archive extracted into it.  It is assigned to the variable
# MKD_[field1]
