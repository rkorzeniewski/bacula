<h4>The Clients Interface</h4>
<font size=+1>

<p>The Clients interface shows a list of configured client resources.  This
list of clients is a tree structure and shows a number of attributes from the
database for each client. 

<p>The user may right click on a client item to display a context sensitive menu
of what actions can be performed on a client.  This menu has
options to allow the user to perform commands in the console.  These
commands include requesting the status of the client, and pruning or purging
jobs and files from the catalog.  There is also an option to open up a JobList
interface with the control for clients already prepopulated with the selected
client item.

<p>To understand pruning and purging, please read the Bacula documentation at
the following URL: http://www.bacula.org/rel-manual/Bacula_Console.html
