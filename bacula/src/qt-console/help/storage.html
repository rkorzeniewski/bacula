<h4>The Storage Interface</h4>
<font size=+1>

<p>The Storage interface shows a list of configured storage device resources.
The list is a tree structure and shows the storage id and the auto changer flag.

<p>The interface allows the user to right click on an item to popup a context
sensitive menu of the actions that can be performed with that storage device.
The actions allow performing commands in the console.  The commands include
requesting the status of the storage, and to mount, unmount or release the media
in the storage device.

<p>If the autochanger flag is true, two additional options in the context
sensitive menu are found.  These are options to run the command to update slots
and the command to update slots scan.
