<h4>What is the BAT.</h4>

<p>Welcome to the Bacula Administration Tool.  The bat is the graphical interface 
to communicate with and administer the bacula director daemon.  If you have been
using bacula for a while, you're familiar with bconsole, the text based interface
to administer bacula.  With bat, the user can perform any command that can be
run from bconsole, and more.

<p>The bat is bconsole with extra communication capabilities and a set of 
graphical user interfaces that utilize those capabilities.  A bat programmer is 
able to create interfaces that interact with the director in all ways that a user
can, by executing commands.  When a command is entered by an interface, the bat
types in the command in the console.  Often times the interface visible is
changed to the console so that the user can read the command as well as the
resulting output from the director.  Bat can also perform requests of the
daemon, that the user would not normally do.   These requests would include the ability to
retrieve lists of various resources and to instruct the director
to query the sql server.  The director then forwards the query results to bat.
