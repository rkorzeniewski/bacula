<h4>The Jobs Interface</h4>
<font size=+1>

<p>The Jobs interface shows a tree of configured job resources.  The data displayed
for each job in this list are the defaults for the job resource as defined in
the bacula-dir configuration file.  When a job is run due to being scheduled, 
these defaults are the values that are used.  They are also the values 
that are populated by default if the job is run manually.

<p>The context sensitive popup menu includes a number of options.  There are 
options to run commands and there is an option to open up a different
interface.

<p>The user can run a list files command in the console that displays a
list of jobid's that have been run and some associated data.  This is similar
output to what can be seen in the joblist interface.

<p>The list volumes console command can be run to output a list of volumes that
have this jobs files stored on it.

<p>The list nextvolume console command tells the user the next volume that
will be asked for when the job is run.  It also shows a list of past jobs.

<p>There is a preferences item to determine whether a long list or a short list
command is run.  It can be found from the menu by following settings -
preferences then the miscellaneous tab.

<p>There are options to run commands to either enable or disable the job as scheduled.
If disabled, the job is re-enabled when the director daemon is restarted.

<p>The cancel job command is to cancel any running job id's with the job
definition.

<p>The open joblist option is to open a new JobList interface and pre-populate
the job dropdown list with the jobs resource name.

<p>The run job option is to open the Run a Job interface prepopulating the job
dropdown box with the selected job.  With the job name in the job dropdown box
of the Run a Job interface, the remainder of the controls are populated with
the jobs defaults.
