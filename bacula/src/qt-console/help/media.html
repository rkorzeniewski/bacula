<h4>The Media Interface</h4>
<font size=+1>

<p>The Media interface displays a tree structure of pools, and under each
pool branch, are items representing the volumes in the pool.  The display
shows data that are the values in the database for each volume.  With this
interface, the user can manage tape volumes and file volumes.

<p>When the user right clicks on a volume item, a context sensitve menu appears
that shows the actions that can be performed on this volume.  This menu allows
the user to open up other interfaces and to perform commands in the console.
There are command options that modify the catalog.  These commands include
deleting the volume, purging the jobs/files which have been written to the volume, and pruning the 
jobs/files that meet the pruning criterion configured in
bacula-dir.conf.  There is also a command to reset the parameters on the volumes
based on the parameters of the pool resource.

<p>Other interfaces can be opened up from the context sensitive menu.
The user can open up the Relabel a Volume dialog box.  The user can also open
up the Edit a Volume interface which allows the user to modify all user
editable data items for the volume.  Another interface that may be opened is
the JobList.  When created the media drop down control is preselected to the
volume.  It lists jobs which have been written to the volume.
