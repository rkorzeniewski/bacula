cancel ujobid=<unique-jobid>

delete pool=<pool-name>
   should ask if this would have bad effects if say media existed in the pool
   the pool existed in the configuration file.

list
   list ujobid<unique job name> (list job with unique name)
   list nextvol job=<job-name> days=nnn

unmount [ jobid=<id> | job=<job-name> ]
Mmmmm

update 
  /* Attempted, having problems */
  Volume from Pool All Volumes from Pool

CONFIG FILE
===========================
add [pool=<pool-name> storage=<storage>  jobid=<JobId>]
These are done from config files

create [pool=<pool-name>]
Done in a config file

CHOOSE NOT TO (for now at least)
===========================
autodisplay on/off
could be done in the context of the console
   This may interfere with our connection issues
   Also, there is a configurable qt timer to automatically ask for messages

python
not needed from bat??

setdebug
I'd say we could choose not to implement this in bat

quit
I'd like to have a disconnect graphical option.

exit
Not really needed

use
still need to make decisions about how to handle multiple catalogs

version
could be done in console as long as it is explicite about that it is the version
of the director

var
Mmmmmm

wait
Mmmmmmm

DONE
===========================
automount on/off
Added buttons to the label dialog box to execute automount command

cancel jobid=<number> job=<job-name>

delete [volume=<vol-name> job jobid=<id>]

disable job<job-name>     and     enable job<job-name>
Could be done in the context of a jobs resource window which is not yet created

estimate
Could be a dialog in the context of a jobs window.

list
   list jobid=<id>           (list jobid id)
   list files jobid=<id>
   list jobmedia jobid=<id>
   list volumes jobid=<id>
   list jobtotals (from page selector on joblist widget)
   The next few are accomplishable graphically with joblist class
     list jobs
     list job=<job-name>   (list all jobs with "job-name")
     list jobname=<job-name>  (same as above)
     list jobmedia
     list jobmedia job=<job-name>
   The next few are accomplishable graphically with the medialist class
     list volumes
     list volumes pool=<pool-name>
     list volume=<volume-name>  
     list pools
   Accomplishable with the clients class graphically
     list clients
   list files job=<job-name>
  do this as a context option on page selector on joblist
   list volumes job=<job-name>
   list nextvolume job=<job-name>
   list nextvol job=<job-name>

help
  context sensitive from page selector console

label
Done by kern before I started

prune files|jobs|volume client=<client-name> volume=<volume-name>
could add as a dialog box from both client and medialist

purge files jobid=<jobid>|job=<job-name>|client=<client-name>
purge volume|volume=<vol-name> (of all jobs)
purge jobs client=<client-name> (of all jobs)

relabel

release storage=<storage-name>
Would need to explain what this does in bat with a dialog

run

reload

status

unmount storage=<storage-name> [ drive=\lt{}num\gt{} ]

update volume (via mediaedit)
  "update slots" "update slots scan" (context of storage)
