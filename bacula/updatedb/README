updatedb scripts
13 Feb 2004

These scripts may be used to update older versions of bacula
databases. The scripts are designed using the standard install
locations for mysql, sqlite and the bacula working directory
as configured in the rpm builds. If you have different locations
you will need to edit the $bindir variable and the working
directory location before running them.

Please note normally the scripts in this directory are needed only
if you want to update multiple versions of the database.  If if
you are upgrading from an older database one version before the
current database version, (e.g.  version 8 to 9) the normal
procedure is to use the:

   ./update_bacula_tables

script which will be installed in your scripts directory (default
/etc/bacula).  It can also be found in the
<bacula-source>/src/cats directory.
