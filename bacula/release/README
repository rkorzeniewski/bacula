This directory contains the scripts that we use to create a new
set of release files.

In general, you do the following:

1. Copy the entire contents of this directory out of the 
   Bacula source tree (this may not be required, but is cleaner).

2. Edit the config file, and update the following enviroment variables
   to point to the correct directories on your system.  They should
   point to directories that contain git repos:

   bacula
   docs
   rescue

   Also ensure that you have set repo to the name of your repository.
   Normally, it is origin, but some developers (Kern) use bee.

3. Ensure that "branch" is properly set to the right version in
   the config file.

4. Note, the release version is obtained from bacula/src/version.h and
   put into a number of files in the release by the release scripts.

5. Run the makeall script.  

   ./makeall

6. There should be no errors.  If 
   there are, fix them, and re-run the script or re-run the scripts
   that makeall calls:

7. All the output files should be put in this directory.

8. Before releasing, detar the main Bacula source into some
   directory and run all the regression tests using the files
   in the bacula-xx.xx.xx.tar.gz file.  This ensures that there
   are no missing files.          

9. Also before releasing, run at least one backup using the 
   Win32 and/or Win64 file daemon.

10 When you are sure, run:

   pushtags

   which will push each repo and push the tags.
