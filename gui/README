This is the Bacula GUI directory. It contains graphical tools for
Bacula, and consists of the following subdirectories:

  Directory          Contents
  bacula-web         A management level tool for reporting Backup
                     job status. It is a Web based application that
                     uses php.
  bimagemgr          A web based tool for managing and burning CD
                     images of Volumes created by Bacula.

Build instructions:                       

First, you must do:

  cd <gui>
  ./configure --with-bacula=<path-to-bacula-source>

  This will find the current Bacula version, and create
  all the Makefiles from Makefile.in  

  Do not edit the Makefiles or your changes will be lost. Always
  edit Makefile.in

For bacula-web: 
  cd bacula-web
  examine the README 
    or alternatively use the html document released as   
    bacula-docs-nn.mm.xx.tar.gz

For bimagemgr:
  There are a number of additional configuration options that
    you may specify on the ./configure line shown above. To see
    them enter: ./configure --help
  cd bimagemgr
  make
  make install
  ...

To create a distribution tar file
   cd <gui>
   ./configure --with-bacula=<bacula-source-directory>
   make clean
   make
   make release

   The output will be two .tar.gz files in the current directory
   with the names bacula-web-<version>.tar.gz and 
   bimagemgr-<version>.tar.gz
   It will print the name.
